Hi, I'm a uni student from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
I'm currently pursuing a degree in Data Science, and I'm interested in AI, 
Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. 

I created this website to document my learning journey and take notes as 
I dive deeper into the world of data science. It serves as a platform where 
I can share my insights, discoveries, and projects with others who share 
the same interests.

When I'm not diving into data, you'll find me exploring new places, 
taking photos, and spending time with friends.
Feel free to reach out to me!
